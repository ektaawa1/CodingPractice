 * 704. Binary Search
 * Given an array of integers nums which is sorted in ascending order,

 * You must write an algorithm with O(log n) runtime complexity.

/**
 * 1) while (left <= right) → Standard Binary Search (find exact element)
 * Use this when you want to check every index, including when left == right.
 * Typical pattern: searching for a specific value
 * After the loop, if not found, you return -1 (or another “not found” indicator).
 *
 * 2) while (left < right) → Search for insertion position / lower bound
 * Use this when you are finding first position that satisfies a condition, not necessarily an exact match.
 * Loop stops when left == right → left is the position you want.
 * Often used in “search for insert position” problems.

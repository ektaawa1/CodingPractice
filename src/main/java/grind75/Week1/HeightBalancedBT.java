/**
 * Why DFS works best here?
 * We need heights of left & right subtrees before checking balance.
 * DFS naturally gives us that in one pass (bottom-up).
 * BFS would need extra bookkeeping of heights at each level and multiple passes → less efficient.
 *
 * So the flow is:
 * DFS down (left & right).
 * While coming back up, compute height and check balance.
 * If any subtree is unbalanced, return -1 immediately (early stop).
 * This is why the algorithm runs in O(n) instead of O(n²).

// TC = O(n), each node is visited once
// SC = O(h), where h = tree height (recursion stack). Worst-case skewed tree = O(n).

/**
 * Notes-Why Math.max(leftHeight, rightHeight) + 1?
 * leftHeight = height of left subtree, rightHeight = height of right subtree
 * Math.max(leftHeight, rightHeight) = the taller side + 1 = count the current node
 *
 * Example-
 *     1
 *    / \
 *   2   3
 *  /
 * 4
 *
 * Node 4: left=0, right=0 → height = max(0,0)+1 = 1
 * Node 2: left=1 (from node 4), right=0 → height = max(1,0)+1 = 2
 * Node 3: left=0, right=0 → height = 1
 * Node 1: left=2, right=1 → height = max(2,1)+1 = 3
 * So the whole tree’s height = 3.

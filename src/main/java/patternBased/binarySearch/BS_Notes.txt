1st Classic Binary Search in Array (Sorted / Monotonic)

First / Last occurrence in sorted array → lower bound / upper bound

Search in Rotated Sorted Array

Find Minimum in Rotated Sorted Array

Find Minimum in Rotated Sorted Array II (duplicates)

Find Peak Element

Pattern: first true / last true on index.
===

2nd Binary Search on Answer / Monotonic Function

Ship Packages Within D Days

Koko Eating Bananas

Split Array Largest Sum

Minimize Max Distance to Gas Station

Divide Chocolate

Maximum Bags With Full Capacity of Rocks

Minimum Limit of Balls in a Bag

Count Negative Numbers in a Sorted Matrix (variation)

Pattern: numeric answer space → monotonic property → feasibility check → first true / last true.
===

3rd Two Pointers + Binary Search Variants

Container With Most Water

Trapping Rain Water (binary search variant in advanced solutions)

Koko Eating Bananas (can combine prefix sum + binary search)

Pattern: sometimes combined with greedy check.

4th Hard Monotonic / Slope Problems

Find Peak Element

Peak Index in a Mountain Array

Find in Mountain Array

Binary Search on Graph / Distance Problems

Pattern: binary search not on indices directly, but over structural property.

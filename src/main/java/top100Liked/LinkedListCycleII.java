/**
 * When slow == fast, they‚Äôve just met somewhere inside the cycle.
 * But that ‚Äúmeeting point‚Äù could be any node in the cycle, not necessarily the one where the cycle begins.
 * üëâ Example:
 * 1 ‚Üí 2 ‚Üí 3 ‚Üí 4 ‚Üí 5
 *         ‚Üë       ‚Üì
 *         ‚Üê ‚Üê ‚Üê ‚Üê
 * Cycle starts at node 3.
 * If you run Floyd‚Äôs algorithm:
 * slow and fast might meet at node 4 (or 5, depending on speed).
 * At that point, slow.next = 5.
 * But the real cycle start is node 3 ‚Üí not slow.next.
 * So slow.next does not always give the cycle entry.
 *
 * Why the head+meeting trick works
 * After they meet:
 * Distance from head ‚Üí start of cycle = a
 * Distance from start ‚Üí meeting point = b
 * Cycle length = c
 * From the math of the algorithm: a = c - b
 * Meaning: if you start one pointer at head and another at the meeting point, moving both one step at a time, they‚Äôll meet exactly at the cycle start.

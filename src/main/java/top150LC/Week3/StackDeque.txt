✅ Should I use Stack or Deque in Java?
1. Stack (java.util.Stack)
✔️ Simple to use — meant for LIFO (Last In First Out).
✔️ Has push(), pop(), peek().
✔️ BUT: It's an old class — synchronized (thread-safe), so slightly slower.

2. Deque (java.util.Deque)
✔️ Recommended since Java 6/7 onwards for stack-like usage.
✔️ Faster — not synchronized (better for single-threaded code or modern usage).
✔️ Use methods:


Deque<Integer> stack = new ArrayDeque<>();
stack.push(val);     // equivalent to Stack's push
stack.pop();        // equivalent to Stack's pop
stack.peek();       // equivalent to Stack's peek

/**
 * 🛠️ Approach (BFS Infection Spread 🔁)
 * 🧭 Start BFS from all initially rotten oranges.
 * 🟢 Keep track of fresh oranges.
 * 🟡 For each minute, infect the 4 neighboring cells (up, right, down, left).
 * 🧮 Count how many fresh got infected.
 * 🧾 If all fresh get infected ➡️ return time.
 * 🚫 If not ➡️ return -1.
